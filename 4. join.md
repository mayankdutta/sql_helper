### Join 

```sql
SELECT
   goal.player,
   goal.teamid,
   game.stadium,
   game.mdate 
FROM
   (
      game 
      JOIN
         goal
   )
   ON ( game.id = goal.matchid) 
WHERE
   goal.teamid = 'GER'
```

### Join with group by

```sql
SELECT teamname,
       Count(goal.player)
FROM   eteam
       JOIN goal
         ON eteam.id = goal.teamid
GROUP  BY eteam.teamname; 
```

### either we can show attributes we have mention in group by, or if we want to show other attributes mention them in aggregate functions. 

```sql
SELECT goal.matchid,
       game.mdate,
       Count(goal.teamid)
FROM   game
       JOIN goal
         ON ( game.id = goal.matchid )
WHERE  ( team1 = 'POL'
          OR team2 = 'POL' )
GROUP  BY matchid,
          mdate 
```

### Multiple joins

```sql
SELECT actor.NAME
FROM   casting
       JOIN actor
         ON ( actor.id = casting.actorid )
       JOIN movie
         ON ( movie.id = casting.movieid )
WHERE  movie.title = 'Casablanca'; 

```
