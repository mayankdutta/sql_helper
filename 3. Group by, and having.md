By including a GROUP BY clause functions such as SUM and COUNT are applied to groups of items sharing values. 
When you specify GROUP BY continent the result is that you get only one row for each different value of continent. 
All the other columns must be "aggregated" by one of SUM, COUNT ...

The HAVING clause allows use to filter the groups which are displayed. 
The WHERE clause filters rows before the aggregation, the HAVING clause filters after the aggregation.

If a ORDER BY clause is included we can refer to columns by their position.

### For each continent show the continent and number of countries with populations of at least 10 million.

```sql
select continent, count(name) from world where population > 10000000 group by continent;
```


### List the continents that have a total population of at least 100 million.

```sql
select continent from world group by continent having sum(population) >= 100000000;
```
